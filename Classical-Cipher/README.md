# Classical Cipher
The classical cipher is not as strong as before but it still full of legendary and charm.

In here I want to introduce some kinds of classical ciphers and provide some simple implementations.

## 1: CaeserCipher:

	The caeser cipher have 26 likehoods its from 0 to 25
	Enumeration is effective! 
	
	Caeser cipher is a typical representation of the classical substitute chipher 
	You can find the implementations with C and Python in this fold 

## 2: TranspositionCipher:

```
It can be seen as a enhanced version of Caeser.
They are essentially the same. Subsitute. 
But the keys range of TranspositionCipher is relate to the length of your cleartext ( Usually choose the key between 2 and the half length of your claertext )
```
